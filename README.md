Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

This library provides a bundled version of these fonts that can easily be used in your Java/JavaFX-based applications.

A compiled and ready-to-use version of this library can be found in the
Sonatype OSS Maven Repository (oss.sonatype.org). To use the library
